##  STD_Pytorch

Due to the limited time to complete this project and my poor comprehend to the structure of such model, this code may not a correct implement of STD model, in other word, it may not work.

### Datasetï¼šKITTI

The following are demo of ground_truth

### First Stage PGM

This stage is to generate the proposal. Because of the limitation of GPU source, I only keep up to 128 proposal in training but not the 300 in the paper.

the following is a demo of the generated proposal

Due to the limited data we used for training(200 raw point clouds), the model may not perform well in the angle prediction
